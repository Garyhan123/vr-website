<h1 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>The Kremer Museum</span></h1>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>October 27, 2017, NEW YORK &#8211; </span></b><span lang=EN-US>On
Thursday, October 26, 2017, at an exclusive event at Sotheby’s New York for
select guests from the art world and technology industry, the <a
href="http://www.thekremercollection.com/">Kremer Collection</a> announced the
launch of the Kremer Museum, an innovative new concept that combines
cutting-edge technology with world-class masterpieces. Designed by architect
Johan van Lierop, Founder of Architales and Principal at Studio Libeskind, the
museum will feature over 70 17th Century Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings
from the Collection and will be accessible exclusively through Virtual Reality
(VR) technology.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>For the creation of the
museum, each painting has been photographed between 2,500 and 3,500 times using
the ‘photogrammetry’ technique to build one ultra high resolution visual model
for each painting, allowing the museum’s visitors to enjoy a deeply immersive
experience with the paintings. Using VR technology, visitors will be able to
examine the artworks’ surface and colors up-close, as well as view the reverse
of the paintings to explore each work’s unique stamps of provenance.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>Discussing the
establishment of the Kremer Museum, George Kremer, Founder of the Kremer
Collection, says, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“Our journey as
collectors has always been about finding the highest quality artworks and
simultaneously finding ways to share them with as many people as possible. My
wife Ilone and I believe we can make a greater contribution to the art world by
investing in technology rather than in bricks and mortar for our collection.” </i></span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>On designing the
museum, architect Johan van Lierop notes<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>,
“To design a museum without gravity, plumbing or code regulations is a dream
for every architect.”&nbsp;</i></span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>van Lierop continues,<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> “I think VR is to the 21st century what
Dutch Realism was for the Golden Age, allowing the observer to escape into an
alternative reality or mindset. Architecture often uses VR to enhance a
project’s representation before it is built, often for real estate sales
purposes, but using VR to embrace architecture as a spatial experience on
itself was very unique to me. VR opens up a whole new realm for the
architectural practice, where ideas and concepts are no longer bound to the
limits of passive visuals but can be a fully immersive experience.”</i></span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>This virtual museum,
which features meticulously recreated paintings and an exceptional space whose
design alludes to the scientific and artistic vigor of the Golden Age, will be
a leap forward in making it truly possible for the public to experience
masterworks in a museum setting, regardless of background and location.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>George Kremer
continues, “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Kremer Museum is a
combined result of what we appreciate as collectors and art lovers, such as
perfect lighting, the possibility to look at the back of the paintings, and a
perfectly designed space by a world-class architect, and the hard work and
vision of an incredibly committed team of highly talented and innovative
producers and developers to make this come to life. The final product that Jo&euml;l
Kremer and his team have innovated pushes all boundaries &#8211; the resolution of
the visuals is of a higher quality than the human eye can process, the museum
is ready to scale to the improvements made to the resolution of the hardware in
the near future, and therefore the experience will only get better and better.”</i></span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>In the coming months,
the Collection will host a number of exclusive pop-up events with a full VR
set-up. Dates will be announced on the Kremer Collection’s website in due
course. In early 2018, the museum will release a mobile application on Google
Play Store for Daydream that will allow people to visit the museum with any
Google Daydream-ready smartphone and VR mask.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Mighty Masters</span></b></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>In conjunction with the
opening of the museum, the Kremer Collection is also launching the TKC Mighty
Masters program, which will provide VR tools to select schools around the world
to fully access the museum. To select its first schools, the program will
partner with India’s <a href="http://www.deliveringchangefoundation.org/">Delivering
Change Foundation</a> to host a drawing contest among over one million children
in India. The museum and the Mighty Masters program together demonstrate George
&amp; Ilone Kremer’s strong commitment to education and the accessibility of
art and their strong belief in art’s unique capacity to make people, and
children in particular, feel free and empowered.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>Ahead of the roll-out
of the TKC Mighty Masters program in 2018, on Tuesday, October 24, 2017, a
first set-up of the Kremer Museum was realized at Cornerstone Academy for
Social Action in the Bronx, NY, where a group of 20 children were invited to be
the very first visitors of the museum in the presence of Jo&euml;l Kremer, Director,
Kremer Collection and Co-Founder, Kremer Museum.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>Commenting on this
experience, Jo&euml;l Kremer says, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“This was a
truly eye-opening experience for me; the children’s uncensored and
overwhelmingly positive response to the museum blew me away. To me, the fact
that they referred to it as a game and their eagerness to learn more about what
they were looking at illustrated how exciting and interactive the museum is,
not just to us as builders and founders, but more importantly to our visitors
and to the future beneficiaries of the Mighty Masters program.”</i> &nbsp;</span></p>
