                    <p>Evidence shows that horses were originally used as a food source long before their strength and speed was harnessed for riding and driving purposes. Although it is uncertain exactly when horses were first domesticated and ridden it is known that they were used for hunting purposes, to pull chariots, transport supplies, go into countless battles and for farming.
                        With improvements being made to the training of horses and to the riding tack used, horse riding became a more safe and comfortable proposition, allowing the horse to be used for a number of purposes such as a scout and delivery of the post.

                        Today the horse riding skills learnt over the years are practiced, developed and taught all over the world. Horses are now not only bred and trained for competition but also used for work and as pleasure horses where they are used for a number of activities both ridden an driven .
                        To date, certain findings, and certain approximate dates have come to light.

The horses had to be fast and agile and because neither they or there riders were heavily armored the lightweight horse breeds such as the Arab and Akhal Teke were used.</li>
                            <li>Medium weight horses were required by the Iron age to accommodate the increase in weight of the armour and also to enable the horses to pull heavier chariots, supply wagons and armory.

Podhajsky wrote books outlining the training of the horse and rider from basic principles through to more advanced techniques.</li>
                            <li>Podhajsky is also well known for saving the beautiful stallions of the Spanish riding school from being killed during world war two by using his friendship with General Patten to place the stallions under American protection and for the rescue of several horses that had been seized from the Piber stud by moving them out of harms way to Austria.</li>
