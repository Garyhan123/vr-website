<h2 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>Meta ride inside a
Reggie Watts dream.</span></h2>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>Burning with
originality, intelligence, and a deft use of the medium, Reggie Watts weaves a
virtual reality story that is a dream-within-a-dream meta-ride down the rabbit
hole, where the only constants seem to be his philosophical musings, comedic
insights, and musical genius.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;The idea was to
do something in VR that was comical because a lot of the work I had seen was
very serious. I wanted to do something silly and playful. Reggie (Watts) and I
kept talking about Monty Python and Terry Gilliam’s animation. We initially
envisioned the piece as an indoctrination video for a fake cult. The idea is
that someone approaches you on the street. They ask if you want to come to a
party and before you know it you’ve joined a cult. We intended it to be
Psychedelic. The word etymologically means “visible breath”. <span class=GramE>Basically</span>
the point at which the invisible becomes visible. Reggie and I talked a lot
about VR being like a parallel reality. We wanted to riff off the concept of
virtual reality within a virtual reality piece. There is the white room and
then you’re switching channels and within the virtual reality level you put on
another VR helmet and enter a completely mental space.&quot; -Benjamin
Dickinson/Director</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Since I was a
little kid, I was interested in the idea of immersing myself in a virtual world
by simply using the View-Master, which was really my first experience at
looking at a stereoscopic image, its color, its analogue, <span class=SpellE>its</span>
on film discs. It just looks so cool. As a kid, I was really interested in that
feeling like you’re in another reality. And then you started seeing movies
about virtual reality - Lawnmower Man was one, The Matrix, even the idea of time
travel is a form of virtual reality. And what really excites me about VR is
that it’s now possible.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>I’ve known Ben
Dickinson for a long time. He directed a lot of my videos. VR is something I
have been dreaming about. It totally captivates me. Ben and I went about
designing an experience that I thought would, in a creative sense, be
fascinating as a viewer. But we also wanted to use the technology to create a
fluid experience. I’m really into transitions. How do you cross from one
reality to another? </span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>I wanted to have a
filmic element to it, because I think <span class=GramE>reality based</span>
immersion is kind of a great grounding place as opposed to just immediately
going into some weird amorphous reality. I like this idea of being guided
through the experience and also the idea of misdirection. I also thought it
would be really funny to go inside of a simulation inside of the actual
simulation. It was a dream of mine and also seemed a very clever way of
transitioning to another reality.</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>With Waves we took a
lot of chances and there is really nothing out there like it. VR is a nascent
medium where we still need to figure out the language, or invent it if you
will. We will only achieve this by pushing the boundaries of what we know. This
is why it is so important that we collaborate with other filmmakers and
storytellers. We learn from them as much as they learn from us when we teach them
what we know about VR.&quot; -Luis <span class=SpellE>Blackaller</span>/
Creative Director</span></p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Wevr’s</span> goal is embracing creatives like Ben and Reggie and
taking their ideas and kind of <span class=SpellE>VRing</span> them. We worked
with them to refine their ideas so they were feasible and interesting as a VR experience.
The end result surpassed all our expectations. They collaborated incredibly
well and extended themselves to the medium in ways that we didn’t expect. The
piece integrates Reggie into these fantastical worlds and some phenomenal
animation. It really explores the merging of video and animation in VR in a way
that we haven't seen before. There’s this mix of satirical comedy and music and
immersive storytelling working all at once and we were totally blown
away.&quot; -Anthony Batt/ Co-Founder <span class=SpellE>Wevr</span>.</span></p>
