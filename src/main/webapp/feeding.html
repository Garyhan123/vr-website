                        5-15 gallons of water per day. If possible, make sure that your horse has access to water at all
                        times. Otherwise, make sure that you water your horse at least twice per day and allow several
                        minutes for your horse to drink. Make sure that the water in your horse’s trough is clean and
                        not frozen. Keep the trough clean as well by hosing it out every day.

                        carbohydrates, like hay and grass, are essential to a horse’s diet. Horses eat large quantities
                        of hay and grass as their main source of food. In fact, horses should eat about 15-20 pounds or
                        1-2% of their body weight in hay every day, so make sure that your horse always has plenty of
                        hay to chew on.[4]
                        Make sure that the hay you feed your horse is free of mold and dust.

                        carbohydrates, like oats, corn, and barley, are also essential to a horse’s nutrition. Provide
                        small amounts of grain to your horse throughout the day. Every day, horses can also have ½ pound
                        of grain per 100 pounds of body weight. Feed grain to your horse in two or three evenly spaced
                        feedings during the day.
                        Make sure to measure the portions that you feed your horse to make sure that you are giving her
                        the correct amount.
                        If the weather is hot, feed grain to your horse during the cooler hours of the day, such as
                        early in the morning and later in the evening.

                        minerals. Although your horse will get most of its calories from hay and grass, you should feed
                        your horse some fortified feed each day to help meet any nutritional gaps. Protein, fat,
                        vitamins, and minerals are important parts of your horse’s nutrition, but they are not required
                        in large amounts.

                        be careful not to overload your horse with too many vitamins. An excess of vitamins can cause
                        problems just like a deficiency of vitamins can.

                        <span>03</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine what type of weight gain you want for your horse. Do you want to keep
                        your horse at the level it is already at (maintenance diet)? Do you want to reduce the horse's
                        weight because of health issues (reduction diet)? Or, do you want to increase your horse’s body
                        weight due to a past illness or because your horse is underweight?
                        The best strategy to use when developing a feeding plan for your horse is to feed based on the
                        desired weight, rather than the current weight. e.g. A horse is underweight and weighs 300kg. If
                        the horse’s ideal weight is 400kg, don't feed 2.5% of 300kg. Feed 2.5% of 400kg.
                        Use the same strategy for an overweight horse. Feed based on the desired weight, and not
                        current, meaning you will actually be feeding less that the overweight amount, meaning, a
                        reduction of waistline for your horse.

                        Control the energy level in forage by feeding different types or a mix of types. Different
                        forage have different amounts of DE (digestible energy) this depends on the type of forage
                        (grass, haylage, hay, oat straw) and the type of grass (rye, timothy, cocksfoot or orchard
                        grass). For grazing the time of year also affect the DE. Spring grass has a high level while
                        winter grazing is very poor. For preserved grass the “cut” affects the DE. Early cut grass is
                        higher in DE than late cut grass. Oat Straw is very low in DE. The best way to find out the
                        nutritious in your forage is to have it analyzed.

                        (becoming over excited and spooky). Feeding these horses slow-release energy (fiber and oil)
                        will help, this is the safest form of energy and causes the least amount of health problems.
                        Other horses are lazy and lack “sparkle”. Feeding fast-release energy (starch found in
                        cereals/grains like oats and barley) can help. Starch has been connected with a number of health
                        problems and must be restricted for some horses.

                        If your horse has been out to pasture all day and has been eating lots of grass, she will not

                    <p>
                        <span>02</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;chedule feedings for an hour before or after you have ridden your horse. Don’t
                        feed your horse right before or right after she has finished doing something strenuous because
                        blood flow will be diverted away from her organs and that can interfere with digestion. Plan
                        feedings around your horse’s scheduled activity.
                        If your horse will be doing something extra strenuous, schedule her feeding for three hours
                        before the activity.

                        <span>03</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make gradual changes to your horse’s diet. If you need to change your horse’s
                        feed, do not just switch to the new feed. Start by replacing 25% of the old feed with the new
                        feed. In two days, replace 50% of the old feed with the new feed. Two days after that, replace
                        75% of the old feed with the new feed. Then two days after that you will be able to give your
                        horse 100% new feed.
                        In addition to making food changes gradually, you should also feed your horse at about the same
                        time every day. Horses perform better when they have a regular feeding schedule.
                        Making drastic changes to your horse’s feed or feeding schedule can lead to equine colic and
                        founder. Equine colic is a condition that causes severe abdominal pain and may even require
                        surgery. Founder is a condition that causes poor circulation and can even lead to the separation
                        of the hoof from the foot. Founder is often fatal.
