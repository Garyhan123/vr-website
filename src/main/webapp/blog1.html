                <p>When I was younger, it was always such a thrill to go to Dressage at Devon on Saturday night and
                    watch the Grand Prix Freestyles, which are almost always performed in front of a sold-out crowd.
                    Those Devon fans, known for cheering and really getting into it, are a huge part of what makes this
                    show on Philadelphia’s Main Line so special.</p>
                <p>There truly is no show like Dressage at Devon. It was always my dream to show there, and I’ve never
                    been disappointed since I started competing at this iconic venue, where everything except the arena
                    fences is painted that special shade of “Devon blue.”</p>
                <p>
                <div class="content1_img">
                    <img src="image/blog1/1.jpg"/>
                </div>
                <p>This year was the first time I ever rode a freestyle there. My freestyle is extra special, because it
                    was created as a tribute to my horse of a lifetime, Fitzhessen (Freestyle X Florestan).</p>
                <p>Fitz was my best friend and “heart horse,” the full brother to my current ride, Faolan. Three years
                    ago, I lost my Fitz after he contracted laminitis and nothing we did could make him better, so we
                    let him go. Our freestyle trot tour is to Pink's song, "Who Knew", which is a song about losing a
                    beloved friend.</p>
                <p>It can be a quite emotional part of the freestyle for my mother and anyone who knows our story, when
                    we hit the diagonal in our extended trot and Pink's vocal comes on: "If someone said three years
                    from now you'd be long gone…Who knew?"</p>
                <p>When I competed Fitz in our first CDI at Devon, back in 2012, it truly was a dream come true. Life
                    goes on, and Faolan has really blossomed into a horse beyond my wildest dreams. At just eight years
                    old, this stallion already has far surpassed where his older brother left off.</p>
                <p>Showing at Devon is always a blast, because so many people come to watch that it feels as if we're
                    showing in front of a hometown crowd, since we live just across the Pennsylvania state line in New
                    Jersey. Everywhere you go at Devon, you run into people that you know. To top it all off, it
                    actually was uncharacteristically sunny this year, with no rain.</p>
                <p>The best part, of course, was the fact that both of my homebred horses did well at Devon. Faolan
                    produced one of our best CDI Small Tour results so far. He finished in third place in the
                    Intermediaire I with a 68.991 percent. The following day, he was sixth in the I-1 Freestyle with
                    another 68. He's continued to get stronger as the year goes on.</p>
                <div class="content1_img">
                    <img src="image/blog1/2.jpg"/>
                </div>
                <p>Fauna, my other Devon ride, was second and third in the FEI 6-year-old classes. I also showed her in
                    an open Fourth Level class, where she tied for fourth, and ended up fifth against some very nice
                    horses in a rather large class.</p>
                <p>Even though I sold Fauna in the spring, I've been fortunate enough to keep her in training, and
                    continue to compete all year without skipping a beat. She qualified and competed at the U.S. Young
                    Horse Championships during the summer at Lamplight Equestrian Center in Illinois, where she finished
                    sixth among the country's six-year-olds.</p>
                <p>From there, she went to the Region 8 Championships, where I rode her in both the Third- and
                    Fourth-Level Open Championships. She earned a wild card Invitation to next month’s U.S. Finals in
                    Kentucky after the Region 8 Open Fourth Level Championships, where she placed fourth, earning more
                    than 68 percent.</p>
                <p>I opted to compete Faolan in the CDI in Saugerties, N.Y., instead of regional qualifying
                    championships for the U.S. Finals. I decided that he didn't need to go to Kentucky, since he went
                    the last two years. I would rather focus on his training and development this fall instead of going
                    to one more show.</p>
                <p>I'll be spending the next few weeks getting ready to wrap up a memorable 2017 show season in
                    Kentucky, so wish me luck!</p>
