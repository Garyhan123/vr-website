<h2><span lang=EN-US>Jumpstarting the Visual Resource Center</span></h2>

<p><span lang=EN-US><img width=440 height=440 id="图片 1"
src="art5.files/image001.jpg"></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>In January I joined the Visual Resource Center of the <a
href="http://arthistory.ucr.edu/">Art History</a> department at UC Riverside.
I’ve been in the new gig for approximately two months. Its been a
joy&nbsp;getting to know the campus community which functions very much like a
small city. I was surprised to learn that UCR is the 5th oldest university in
the UC system. It is home to the Citrus Experiment Station, the campus is
surrounded by citrus groves and there are many public fruit trees on campus. I
am about a foot too short to reach the remaining pomelos right now and I have
given serious thought to investing in a fruit picker basket. The university is
UCR is incredibly diverse and has an aggressive <a
href="http://strategicplan.ucr.edu/ucr2020.html">strategic plan</a> to position
itself as a premier research university. It is currently in a period of growth
and expansion, this includes the Art History department which is in the midst
of a search for an Islamacist.&nbsp;Visual Resources is at the crossroads of
art, technology, teaching, and research.&nbsp;I feel very lucky that I get to
learn something new everyday.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>My first priority I’m working on is getting our DAM
configuration settled and web galleries published so they are accessible to
faculty and students. We have a general purpose digital image collection that
is available to students and faculty but we’d really like to see active use of
web galleries for private faculty collections as well as galleries created for
specific classes. The DAM tool we are using (Portfolio 2016) does a pretty
seamless job out of the box, but we’ve made a few tweaks to meet our workflow
&amp; metadata needs. It’s important to acknowledge all the work that goes into
the creation and management of these assets, before the images get to
publishing stage. First there is image capture via camera or scanner. Sometimes
there is editing of images supplied by faculty, perhaps phone snapshots taken
while researching in the field or in libraries/archives. There is art
historical research involved in identifying and cataloging the object depicted,
which then gets translated into metadata for search-ability and image metadata
involved so that the right assets&nbsp;are discoverable at the right time.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US><img border=0 width=550 height=403 id="图片 2"
src="art5.files/image002.png"></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>One of the workflow tweaks I made was to match the
cataloging fields with exact names in the cataloging tool so that the use is
clear and so that import/export will be that much easier.&nbsp;Another was to
lower the dependence on Smart Galleries&nbsp;as part of the workflow because
too full/too many dynamic galleries&nbsp;drags the speed and performance of
Portfolio. We now have one smart gallery driven by metadata, that tells us when
archive images are ready to be processed into access files. This gallery also
serves as a checksum to verify recently processed images. I&nbsp;foresee
continual optimization of the workflow, but this seems to be working well for
us and I couldn’t be happier. I’m also thrilled&nbsp;to report that our
current&nbsp;workflow, metadata schema, and legacy documentation&nbsp;is now
published to an internal wiki so it can be a resource for future training or upgrades.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>Right now, we have a class gallery for a professor teaching
Latin American art that is updated shortly after the end of class each week.
Many of these images are protest art, a relevant topic for 2017, and are not
found in the usual repositories. The content&nbsp;provided to the VRC by the
professor via PDF’d powerpoint are then sourced for better quality images,
object/image catalogued, and ingested into the DAM. Within a day or so, the
students can then access a (responsive!) web gallery to study from. I am told
that this gallery is much easier to navigate than the repository made available
through the&nbsp;university’s online learning system. We were able to host
video too which is very exciting! More work to be done in this area, but we are
looking forward to supporting more video&nbsp;formats and other a/v materials.
What other multimedia file formats might we support; VR, GIS, data vis, 3D
models or architecture?</span></p>
