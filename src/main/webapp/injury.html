                <p>The front feet take the brunt of landing after a jump and structures in the hoof capsule work
                    together to handle the shock. The coffin joint—the meeting point of the small pastern bone, the
                    navicular bone in the heel and the coffin bone in the toe—disperses the force. Ligaments that lash
                    the joint together stretch then spring back. So does the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs
                    behind the joint and helps support the navicular bone. </p>
                <p>
                <h3>What happens: The feet are designed to handle great forces, but jumping fence after fence takes a
                    toll. Common problems include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strains and tears in the DDFT or the ligaments in the foot</li>
                    <li>Inflammation in the coffin joint or in the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac that helps
                        cushion the navicular bone from the pressure of the DDFT
                    </li>
                    <li>Deep bone bruising, which can appear in any of the foot bones</li>
                    <li>Inflammation and degeneration of the navicular bone</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>“Sometimes there are multiple problems, Dr. Davidson says. “Again, these are injuries that occur
                    through wear and tear—damage builds up until it hits the tipping point.”</p>
                <p>What you see: “Because the injured structures are hidden by the hoof capsule, you don’t see swelling
                    or other signs,” Dr. Davidson says. “Often these problems are bilateral, involving both front feet,
                    so the horse may not be obviously lame. He may begin to move with shorter strides, but the gait is
                    still symmetrical.” Or the horse may be lame and improve with rest, but be sore again when he goes
                    back to work. He may rest a front foot or shift weight from one foot to the other when
                    standing. </p>
                <p>What to do: A lameness exam and diagnostic nerve blocks will help the vet determine the general site
                    of soreness. Often it’s in the heel, or caudal, region, where several key structures come together.
                    But to treat the problem, you need to know which structures are injured. </p>
                <p>X-rays can reveal bone damage, but they won’t show soft-tissue injuries. Ultrasound is great for
                    imaging soft tissues in the leg, but it’s hard to get a clear ultrasound image in the hoof capsule.
                    The best tool, Dr. Davidson says, is MRI. “With MRI we are able to look inside the hoof capsule and
                    sort out these problems much better than in the past,” she says. The results will help your
                    veterinarian target treatment to fit the injury. </p>
                <p>A tendon or ligament injury needs a long period of rest, six months to a year. You’ll follow more or
                    less the same program as you would with a suspensory injury with stall rest followed by a gradual
                    return to work. The vet may recommend directed injections of platelet-rich plasma or stem
                    cells. </p>
                <p>Inflammation in the coffin joint or the navicular bursa may respond to directed injections of
                    corticosteroids, which are powerful anti-inflammatories, and hyaluronic acid, which is a natural
                    component of cartilage and joint fluid. </p>
                <p>A bone bruise needs rest. This injury isn’t as serious as a fracture, but there is microscopic damage
                    to the bone and fluid builds up within it. Healing can take three or four months depending on the
                    degree of bruising.</p>
                <p>When the navicular bone is chronically inflamed, it responds by remodeling, losing mineral content in
                    some areas and developing lumps of new growth in others. This pattern of inflammation and
                    degeneration is often called navicular disease, and it doesn’t heal with rest. </p>
                <p>What to expect: A horse with a mild injury has the best chance of recovery, but Dr. Davidson notes
                    that rehabilitation can be challenging. “In sporthorses, significant pathology in the foot doesn’t
                    have a good outlook. When the horse goes back to work, he stresses the same structures—so reinjury
                    is likely,” she says.</p>
                <p>Good trimming and shoeing are essential to keep the horse comfortable, regardless of what structures
                    are involved. It’s important to keep the hoof trimmed at the correct angle, so the bones are
                    properly aligned and the foot breaks over easily. Wedge pads or bar shoes can help take pressure off
                    the heels. When problems persist, though, the horse may have to switch to a lighter work
                    program.</p>

                <p><b>Apply direct pressure to stop the bleeding.</b> Grab the cleanest cloth you have at
                    hand---bandages are best but a towel, your shirt or a saddle pad will do---and press it gently but
                    firmly against the wound. Do not ease up on the pressure while the bleeding continues. If the fabric
                    becomes soaked with blood, place another directly over it. If it’s possible, you can also use a
                    bandage to hold the cloth in place.</p>
                <p><b>Find a safe treatment area.</b> If you can do so safely, walk the horse to a quiet, well-lit area
                    with access to running water. However, do not move the horse if you are having difficulty
                    controlling the bleeding or if you suspect there may also be injury to a tendon, ligament or bone.
                    If the horse seems reluctant to move, let him stay where he is until help arrives.</p>
                <p><b>Keep the horse calm.</b> Bringing in a quiet buddy to stand nearby may help settle an anxious
                    horse. If the wound is not on his head or neck, you can offer him hay and water.</p>
                <p><b>Flush the wound.</b> Once the bleeding has slowed, use a gentle stream of water from a hose to
                    rinse the wound as thoroughly as you can. You want to remove any dirt or small debris that may be
                    clinging to the exposed tissues. Do not use a high-pressure spray attachment---you may push debris
                    deeper into the wound. (Note: Skip this step if the bleeding was pulsatile and spurting; if an
                    artery might be involved you do not want to risk restarting the bleeding--- just leave your bandage
                    in place and wait for the veterinarian.) </p>
                <p><b>Look for foreign material.</b> Splinters or other foreign objects stuck in a wound can slow
                    healing. If you see anything, leave it in place until the veterinarian arrives. She may need to
                    determine the depth and track of any punctures within the larger wound. If embedded debris falls
                    away while you are waiting, keep the object to show to your veterinarian.</p>
                <p><b>Examine the rest of the horse, too.</b> A gaping wound will demand your attention, but your horse
                    may have incurred other injuries that also require treatment.</p>
                <h3>What not to do:</h3>
                <p><b>Don't use a tourniquet.</b> When applied in- correctly, tourniquets can damage nerves, muscles and
                    other tis-sues. A horse can lose more than two gallons of blood without serious ill effects; a
                    tourniquet is unlikely to be needed before help arrives.</p>
                <p><b>Don't administer medications to the horse unless your veterinarian instructs you to.</b> If you
                    give the horse oral medications for pain, your veterinarian will not be able to administer
                    faster-acting, more effective intravenous analgesics. You may also mask any signs of lameness.</p>
                <p><b>Don't apply topical aerosols, ointments, powders or salves.</b> Antibacterial ointments can be
                    damaging to healthy tissues, and sticky preparations may interfere with your veterinarian’s efforts
                    to assess and clean the wound.</p>

                <h3>Identifying Eye Problems</h3>
                <p>Your horse's eyes should be clear, bright, and the lids tight, with the inside of the lid pale pink
                    and moist. Tearing should be minimal with perhaps only a droplet at the corner of the eye.
                    Sometimes, if there is dust, dry air or​ wind, a horse’s eye might run a bit, just as yours
                    would.</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An eyelid is cut or torn.</li>
                    <li>The lids are swollen.</li>
                    <li>Obvious damage to the eye itself.</li>
                    <li>There is a white film either over the whole eye or in spots.</li>
                    <li>The eye or any surrounding tissue, including the white sclera and lids, appear red and
                        inflamed.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are tears running down the horse's face which may indicate a torn or blocked tear duct.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any other copious discharge other than a thin tear-like stream.</li>
                    <li>There are tumors growing on or around the lid.</li>
                    <li>In foals, turned under eyelids that cause the eyelashes to rub against the eye.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>First Aid for Eye Injuries and Infections</h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You should have salt or saline solution in your horse's first aid kit. Clean up the area very gently with a saline solution. If you don't have one on hand (like the saline solution for contact lens wearers) you can make some yourself. The ratio is about 1/4 tsp of table salt to a cup of boiled and cooled to lukewarm water. It should taste like tears.</li>
                    <li>Put a fly mask on the horse to keep flies off of the eye area.</li>
                    <li>If possible keep your horse in subdued light such as his stall until the veterinarian arrives.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>How the Veterinarian May Help</h3>
                <p>Rips and tears in the horse's eyelids should be attended to by a veterinarian so the lid can be stitched if necessary. The vet will also check for damage to the lens and anything that may be lodged in the eye (splinters, awns from grasses or grit). A vet can assess the overall health of the eye and may be able to see problems that aren't apparent to the untrained eye.</p>
                <p>The veterinarian will probably give you an ointment or gel to apply to the eye. In some cases, he may draw a vial of the horse's blood and make a solution from it that you will irrigate the eye with. With all medications make sure that you follow the veterinarian's instructions to the letter and be scrupulously clean as you apply any dressings or ointments.</p>
                <h3>How You Can Help Your Horse Heal</h3>
                <p>Just because you see marked improvement within a few days, don't stop the medication until the full course is up. Stopping treatment before the infection or injury is completely healed can result in the infection flaring up again and possibly causing more damage.</p>
                <p>When working with a horse with an eye problem be aware that he may have obscured vision and be a little more spooky than usual. Talk gently so you don't surprise him if you walk up on a 'blind side'.</p>
                <h3>Preventing Eye Injuries</h3>
                <p>Your horse's environment should be as dust free as possible. If hay is dusty, or bedding is very dry and dusty, dampen it or use other fodder or bedding. Make sure that sharp edges on water troughs, metal buildings, pipes or other obstacles are covered or inaccessible. Pound in or pull any old nails that may be protruding from fences or other structures. Many injuries are caused when horses are playing or scraping, and this is almost unavoidable. Just take care to make your horse's home as safe as possible.</p>
